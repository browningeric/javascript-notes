Reasons to learn JS:
    • Empowerment
    • Understanding
    • Vocabulary

*ECMAScript is Javascript, just a standardized format.*

## Objects:
- Everything is an object.
- Objects are collections of things, called properties.
- Primitive Values are the simplest forms of information an object can represent.
- Primitives are not objects, they are values (i.e. just a number)

=== ? == has type coercion, which leads to confusing results, has negative counterpart !== vs !=

Global object: god of objects; in a browser, the window is global object (aka head object or host object)

## Functions:
- When a function is a property of an object, it’s called a method.
- **Q. Creating a function via regular statement vs expression?**
- Stuff inside parentheses = arguments for function.
- **Q. return - stops function? weird**
- **Q. .constructor? What is its purpose?**

## DOM:
- In browser, global object window always has a document node

- console.log! - like an alert but just sends stuff to console (viewable via inspector)
- .select and .focus properties for inputs (neat)
